HORIZONTAL DESIGN SUPPORT:**\n- Detect image orientation (landscape vs portrait)\n- Maintain aspect ratio during export (no squashing)\n- Auto-adjust canvas dimensions based on image orientation\n\n**2. STROKE RENDERING FIX:**\n- Change stroke from inside to outside the font\n- Use proper canvas strokeText before fillText technique\n- Ensure stroke appears as outline, not inline\n\n**3. MOBILE RESPONSIVE DESIGN:**\n- Add responsive grid layouts for mobile devices\n- Optimize touch interactions for drag/resize\n- Ensure all UI elements work on small screens\n\n**4. EXPORT RESOLUTION OPTIONS:**\n- Add resolution selector: 180 DPI vs 300 DPI\n- 180 DPI: 1488x2126px (21x30cm)\n- 300 DPI: 2480x3543px (21x30cm)\n- Apply selected resolution to all exported images\n\n**5. MULTIPLE FILE FORMATS:**\n- PNG export (current)\n- JPG export with quality settings\n- PDF export using jsPDF library\n\n**6. CRITICAL: PREVIEW-TO-OUTPUT ACCURACY:**\n- Fix text size scaling between preview and export\n- Ensure exact positioning match\n- Calculate proper scaling factors for canvas rendering\n- Preview should exactly represent final output\n\n**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Maintain all existing bulk processing functionality\n- Add format/resolution selectors in Process tab\n- Fix canvas scaling calculations\n- Test preview vs output accuracy thoroughly\n- Ensure mobile responsiveness across all tabs\n\nThis is the most important update - the preview must match the output exactly.", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": true, "assignee": "Alex", "start_at": 1756392286.5664644, "end_at": 1756393936.7171679}, {"task_id": "2", "dependent_task_ids": ["1"], "instruction": "Add real-time preview with floating draggable text box to the bulk text overlay tool:\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**\nRestore the interactive preview functionality from the previous version where users can see and position text in real-time on the sample image.\n\n**REAL-TIME PREVIEW FEATURES:**\n1. **Draggable Text Box** - Interactive text overlay that can be moved around the sample image\n2. **Resize Handles** - Allow users to resize the text box for proper scaling\n3. **Live Text Rendering** - Show text with selected font, size, color, and stroke in real-time\n4. **Position Indicators** - Visual feedback for text positioning\n5. **Style Preview** - Real-time preview of all text styling (font, size, color, stroke)\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n- Add canvas overlay on sample image for interactive text positioning\n- Implement mouse/touch drag events for text box movement\n- Add resize handles for text box scaling\n- Render text in real-time with all applied styles\n- Calculate exact positioning coordinates for export\n- Ensure preview scaling matches export scaling (critical)\n\n**PREVIEW-TO-EXPORT ACCURACY:**\n- The draggable text box position must translate exactly to export position\n- Text size in preview must match text size in exported files\n- All styling (font, color, stroke) must render identically\n- Maintain proper scaling ratios between preview and export canvas\n\n**USER WORKFLOW:**\n1. Upload sample image in Design tab\n2. See draggable text box overlay on image\n3. Drag text to desired position\n4. Resize text box as needed\n5. Preview shows exact styling and positioning\n6. Export applies exact same positioning to all target images\n\n**MAINTAIN EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY:**\n- Keep all current bulk processing features\n- Maintain export resolution options (180/300 DPI)\n- Keep multiple file format exports (PNG, JPG, PDF)\n- Preserve mobile responsiveness\n\nWithout this real-time preview, users cannot accurately position text, making the tool unusable for professional work.", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": false, "assignee": "Alex", "start_at": 1756393936.717173}], "current_task_id": "2"}
