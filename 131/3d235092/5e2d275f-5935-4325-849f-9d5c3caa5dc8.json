The preview shows proper Hebrew text styling but export shows different formatting.\n\n2. **Preview-to-Export Mismatch** - Text appears correctly in preview but exports with wrong size/style. Need to ensure exact font size, font family, color, and stroke are applied during canvas export.\n\n**RESET FUNCTIONALITY:**\n3. **Add Reset Button** - Users cannot change or upload new text files. Add a prominent reset button that:\n   - Clears all uploaded files (sample image, target images, text file)\n   - Resets all form inputs to defaults\n   - Clears preview canvas\n   - Returns to initial state\n   - Allows fresh file uploads\n\n**TECHNICAL FIXES NEEDED:**\n- Debug canvas text rendering during export\n- Ensure font loading is complete before export\n- Match preview canvas font metrics with export canvas\n- Verify text positioning calculations are identical\n- Test Hebrew text rendering in export canvas\n- Add proper font fallbacks for Hebrew text\n\n**USER EXPERIENCE:**\n- Add prominent \"Reset All\" button in header or each tab\n- Show confirmation dialog before reset\n- Provide visual feedback during reset\n- Ensure all file inputs accept new files after reset\n\n**TESTING REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Verify Hebrew text exports with correct font and size\n- Test that preview exactly matches exported result\n- Confirm reset clears all data and allows new uploads\n- Test with multiple font sizes and styles\n\nThe exported files must match the preview exactly - this is critical for professional use.", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": true, "assignee": "Alex", "start_at": 1756396902.8507736, "end_at": 1756397406.8922865}, {"task_id": "2", "dependent_task_ids": [], "instruction": "URGENT: Fix critical syntax error in the source code file that's preventing the build from working.\n\n**IMMEDIATE PROBLEM:**\nThe file `/workspace/shadcn-ui/src/pages/Index.tsx` contains editor markup mixed into the actual JavaScript code around lines 361-362:\n```\n361|    };</to_replace>\n362|  </Editor.edit_file_by_replace>\n```\n\n**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**\n1. **Remove ALL editor markup** from the source code file:\n   - Remove `</to_replace>` from line 361\n   - Remove `</Editor.edit_file_by_replace>` from line 362\n   - Remove any other editor command artifacts\n\n2. **Fix the getTextStyle function** - Ensure it ends cleanly with just:\n```javascript\n    };\n  };\n```\n\n3. **Clean up the entire file** - Ensure no other editor markup exists anywhere in the file\n\n4. **Test the build** - Verify that `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run lint` pass without errors\n\n**PRIORITY:**\nThis is blocking the entire application from working. The functionality is implemented but the syntax error prevents compilation.\n\n**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**\n- Build passes without errors\n- Application runs successfully\n- Reset button works to clear all data\n- Hebrew text export matches preview exactly\n- Professional bulk text overlay tool is fully functional\n\nFix the syntax error immediately by removing the editor markup from the source code.", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": false, "assignee": "Alex", "start_at": 1756397406.89229}], "current_task_id": "2"}
